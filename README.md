# Savings Tracker

Proof of Concept/Work in Progress

## About

This project sparked from the need to break down how I should save for a couple of months. Although I could have done this very easily in a spreadsheet, I decided to go a little more in-depth and over-engineer a super simple spreadsheet. This will definitely advance into a system that will track each of my deposits into my savings and tell me the progress I have left. For now, the breakdown of how much I need to contribute every month works well for my use cases.

## Technology

The technology being used in the project is quite simple yet highly effective. I wanted it to be completely serverless, so I could set it up and let it run autonomously. That's why I decided to deploy it on Vercel using Next.js 13 (App Router) and utilizing a Postgres database on Supabase.

The UI was personally styled and designed by me, using TailwindCSS and Radix UI as a wrapper around Tailwind. This allows me to get started very quickly and visualize my backend with ease.
